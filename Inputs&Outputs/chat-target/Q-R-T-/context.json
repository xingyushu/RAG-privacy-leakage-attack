[["input: Hi, I have been diagnosed with a benign neoplasm of the pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct..The size of the tumor is 1.4 cm. Im afraid the result will be surgery. What do you think? I meet with a Opthomologist tomorrow to have a vision screening done b/c my vision is blurred. I have extreme headaches and so much memory loss. I will be seeing a neurosurgeon as well ASAP. Im scared.\noutput: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Yes, your guess is correct. Most likely, your neurosurgeon would advise you for a surgery. However, there is no need to worry, as the tumor of pituitary is most often benign (such as pituitary adenoid or craniopharyngioma). Once they are operated, you would improve for good. The most likely cause of your headaches and memory loss is the tumor. Also, in most cases, the pituitary surgery can be done through nose, without opening the skull. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

I have recently loss my appetite i am getting worried and feeling bad.\noutput: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that the pituitary gland is the most important hormonal gland in our body. It regulated the balance of many hormones. Your symptoms could be related to a hormonal imbalance. That is why I would recommend consulting with an endocrinologist and performing some hormone levels (TSH, LH, GH, GRH, TRY, FSH, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). A new MRI would be needed to evaluate the possible progression of the tumor. Hope you will find this answer helpful!

Last night he swore that mother (did not say which mother) was here.

They may also exhibit other behaviors such as unreasonable or unfounded fears, paranoia, the sense that people are following, watching, or even stealing from them.  If he's been tried on medications such as Risperdal (risperidone), Hall (haloperidol) he may get even worse, so I advise caution to the physician who may suggest this approach.  Your best bet is to connect with a neurologist for an overall examination and review of the history to determiner what tests or imaging studies, as well as blood work, may be helpful.  I know you say that he has medications for memory, however, long term data has unfortunately not revealed very much efficacy of these medications and so approaches that are more proactive in getting him and keeping him involved in activities of a hands-on, as well as cognitive nature, may be helpful.  PHYSICAL EXERCISE is a terrific way to make things a bit more manageable aside from the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular benefits he may reap.

About four weeks ago I was diagnosed with viral meningitis after a CT Scan, MRI (with and without contrast) and a lumbar puncture. I never had a fever or stiff neck - only a headache that would not go away and vomiting on several occasions. I also developed double vision about 10 days after the headache started. The day before the double vision started I had received a clean MRI; however, once my vision was affected (on a Friday afternoon) my primary doctor suggested I may need to go to the ER. The next morning on Saturday I felt worse and experienced more vomiting so I headed to the ER. They admitted me and after 5 days in the neuro ICU and a round of every test they could run, the final diagnosis was (or it seemed like their best guess) was viral meningitis. I ve now been home from the hospital for three weeks and still do not feel well. Additionally, I have seen a neuro-opthalmologist specialist that agrees with the diagnosis. She reviewed the results of the lumbar puncture as well as conducted a round of tests, and she did not find any permanent damage and believes the double vision is post-viral. I still have headaches and feel like I am slightly dizzy and like I am in a bit of a fog. My neurologist says to rest, drink plenty of fluids and be patient; however, I am very depressed and worried that I am never going to feel well again. Also, the double vision is terrible...although the opthalmologist says it is normal for this to take up to several months to go away. Additionally, the neurologist says you are fortunate that you did not suffer a stroke, seizures, memory loss...and that you are walking and talking . While I am greatful that I did not suffer those things, I have not worked in 5 weeks and have no quality of life. The feeling of being in a fog is worse than the headaches.

At times I have a difficulties understanding, either semi complex conversations, or even stories from movie plots etc. Also after growing up in the same city, I have yet been able to remember street names, a task that I would consider simple for your average person. I have came to the conclusion that this has lead me to live the antisocial life that I live in. The reason being is because I have not been able to develop confidence........\noutput: Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is best that you consult a psychiatrist and psychologist for a complete understanding of your case. Memory is just one aspect of mental health and there are various forms of memory like remote memory and recent memory. There are other areas like personality, attitude, mood and interpersonality profile that make you into a social person. There are psychological tests to understand what kind of mental inclination you have. There is a wide range of emotional and mental outlooks, and you are certainly normal but might have to change your own outlook towards others. Understanding problems as complex conversations is a logical function, and sometimes we are only lazy and do not want to involve ourselves in listening to others. Hearing and listening are different. Hearing is passive and listening is with concentration. So you might not be applying concentration when involving yourself in conversations and missing sentences what has been heard leading to the person you are with unable to communicate with you effectively. All your problems can be solved if you consult a psychiatrist and do some higher mental function and psychological tests. A session or two with psychologist will also help you.

It is difficult to make a specific diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder based on the limited information that you have provided.

SucChatDoctorplex psychological disorders have to be diagnosed by a professional, based on a detailed history from reliable informants, such as close family members, and also a detailed psychological assessment.

I suggest you, pls keep your treating doctor aware of side effects if any. And keep going for regular check-ups. By getting rid of the microbes in the organs, plus doing the normal cancer treatments, the balance (i.e. a strong immune system and a low number of cancer cells) is restored enough to keep the cancer from coming back.

Detailed Answer:Hello, Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. As you are experiencing new symptoms, you should see a rheumatologist. He has to do a physical exam to you, in way to detect the cause of your pains. Your doctor might ask you to bend in different directions to test the range of motion in your spine. He or she might try to reproduce your pain by pressing on specific portions of your pelvis or by moving your legs into a particular position. Also, your doctor might ask you to take a deep breath to see if you have difficulty expanding your chest. You should have an X-ray to check for changes in your joints and bones, also. An MRI may be necessary to provide more-detailed images of bones and soft tissues.Meanwhile, you should take in consideration that the main treatment of Alkalosis Spondylitis remains the physical activity. It would be better to begin the exercises after a shower with warm water which will help you with the stiffness. Swimming, volleyball, etc. are the main activities which help decreasing the pain level and conserving the normal posture of your body. Is recommended to stay overthrown for 15-20 minutes for several times a day. If the symptoms does not improve with the physical activity and the anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. Hope this is helpful.

You don't say anything about your medication either. Generally speaking MS is managed by treatment for relapses with short courses of steroids and disease modifying therapy which traditionally has meant interferons or Latimer acetate, while now there are many newer options like fingolimod, omalizumab etc. As for the family understanding there is no medicine for that, you could try to talk about it with them, take them with you when you go for check-ups, so they can hear what your doctors have to say and realize what you go through.

What are your thoughts. I just hate going to see someone because the few times I have sought medical attention nothing conclusive is ever found and it ends up being a waste of my time.\noutput: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical neuromuscular and musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you had a previous MRI, we need to understand the report and also the clinical signs and symptoms too. As you age also should give us some input. To be practical, that 90% of MRI taken will not be having a normal results. So worrying about having an MS should be first removed from the mind. Also, the fatigue can be due to another factor and needs an understanding. It may be due to reduced physical activity of may be due to not a proper diet. A neurologist should assess you initially and go through all the physical examination, chief complaint and diagnostic reports. Understanding that MRI can not be a perfect diagnosis as well. Also, many of the Neurological condition will have similar symptoms and to make a differential diagnosis is needed, without whicChatDoctoring to a straight conclusion is not ethical. As you had double vision, fatigue, headache etc. we need to perform a proper clinical examination and also the chief complains or the past medical history, family history etc. Much More understanding happens if listened to you initially about you.Also, for fatigue you need a proper diet and proper physical exercise to improve the metabolism and immune system as well.

He has been seeing a Cardiologist ever since and a pacemaker/difibrilator was placed to reduce his risk of sudden death. In March his legs started swelling and he was very short of breath and was taken to the ER where he was diagnosed with CHF. He was hospitalized for one day while the fluid was removed and was sent home with strict diet instructions. He s on several medicines to which they ve now added a low dose diuretic. He s done very well sticking with the low sodium diet, exercising, and following all of the lifestyle chances. He has maintained his weight and feels better than he has in a year or more. I m very confused as to his prognosis. When I asked his cardiologist about a prognosis I was told that he has the good kind of heart failure and that the main issue to worry about is sudden death which is why the device was implanted, but when I talk to our family doctor he doesn t seem to think he ll live very long. The ER cardiologist mentioned that he didn t think the ChatDoctor was being managed well enough and changed several dosages of his medicines. He also mentioned that there are two surgeries that are options if his condition worsens. One is an alcohol ablation and the other is septal myectomy. My question is two-fold: Realistically does he fall into the dreaded 50% chance of dying in 5 years, or since the heart failure seems to be caused by the ChatDoctor can either of these two surgeries turn the heart failure around? What is the good kind of heart failure? I ve never heard of such a thing. I m younger than he is and we have a young child together the stress of constantly worrying about his life expectancy is overwhelming.\noutput: Hi, Lets start from the surgery.

When you make a mistake, don't get angry or embarrassed rather laugh at it when others laugh so that slowly you get comfortable and your friends start enjoying your funny company. If you think you lack topic to discuss or talk, buy joke books (read it) and start cracking jokes from time to time. Everyone loves a happy person.

Chronic Asthma/obstructive/restrictive Airway disease produces permanent dilatation and destruction of the alveoli/bronchioles/terminal bronchi thereby reducing the overall surface area of the lungs available for effective exchange of gases at the level of alveoli. The condition is termed as Emphysema. This can be easily made out by a doctor by looking at the chest itself whose anteroposterior diameter is more than the transverse diameter. Have you done all the routine investigations (Blood counts including eosinophil absolute/blood chemistry/urinalysis), chest X-ray PA view and lateral/Pulmonary function tests)1)The only solution is to stop further deterioration by immediately quitting smoking without a second thought.2)Use bronchodilator inhalers and locally acting /short-acting steroidal(Eg-Budesonide/fluticazone) inhalers.3)In an acute attack pls get hospitalized and nebulized with above medications.4)Mast cell Stabilizers such as Sodium Chromoglycate inhalers are also available. It is very useful for prevention of acute attacks.5) In addition breathing exercises will help.6)Avoid dust and house dust mite /keep your residence dust free. Avoid vehicular emissions.  7)In addition Desensitization by identifying a particular allergen can be done by an Immunologist. If the repeated attacks are not prevented premature onset of right heart failure may set in due to pulmonary hypertension. In addition, pls be under the follow-up care of a pulmonologist to avoid /treat acute episodes and by following these steps the further attacks of Asthma and deterioration of Emphysema can be checked.

I suggest you not to worry much.  From the description it is not easy to diagnose you properly. But I see a case of obsession here without any underlying physical / physiological cause.

Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms. Ignore it and the problem vanishes.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms like vomiting, burning chest pain, stomach problems and bowel problem. It is aggravated by alcohol ingestion. So HERD is likely cause in your case. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 7. Avoid alcohol Chat Doctor.  Also avoid smoking if you have this habit.Don't worry, you will be alright.", "input: Hi- Thank you for taking my question.  I had an endoscopy 3/09 due to a constant tight feeling in my upper middle abdomen.  (Still there to this day).  When I woke up from the endoscopy they had me do a barium swallow.  As I came out of the anesthesia I realized I had severe pain in my esophagus.  It was painful to even swallow water.  It lasted about 10 days.  But at the same time I realized that if I move my chest muscles, I feel great pressure in my chest (still to this day). And slowly it became too painful to talk.   I have a voice, but the vibration of it hurts something in what feels like my esophagus.  It becomes very sore. (also bumps in the road etc any vibration hurts.  Question 1) could that endoscopy injury with the barium poured over it be causing these problems?  2) If so, what is going on?  Scar tissue? Barium irritation/inflammation? 3) How to remedy? Thank you so much for your time.  Im in constant pain and I cant use my voice.  Kari\noutput: H. Thanks for your queries and an elucidated history answer your queries:1. Yes it is possible that the endoscopy injury added on with barium study can cause such a problem / pain as you explained .2. To know what exactly is going on you need to undergo another endoscopy and probably a CT scan of the chest. 3. Remedy: for the remedy to be correct, we need the correct diagnosis as to what is the exact problems, for this you need to undergo another endoscopy. *There may probably an injury at the cricophrynx and larynx, hence you have the pain, and can not talk, you have vibrations too. CT scan of the neck is also necessary with that of the Chest. * Till then take PPI, Antacid gels 3 hourly, Risperidone, soft bland diet and continue whatever your Doctor must have advised you."], ["input: hello sir, i need ur help , there is always a story or a play running in my mind. like if i m watching tv show then the story of tv start running in my mind nd i start associating myself with them,,, i feel i m talking with them,,,,,v r doing fun togather..v r going to college nd party...but in real i m in home nd all this is just creation of my mind.. i tried a lot to get rid of these stupdity. i  tried to concentrate on my work to make myself busy. but when i m free. all these absurd thing started again in my mind....my memory is alo become very weak now. i forget things where i placed just a second before... i feel very hesitated to this to my parents ...plz help me what to do\noutput: Hello, I think your problem is OCD.

In the last 2 months, he has had two seizures and if I would not have been there he would have died. I woke up from him twiching. What should I do? Does he need seizure medicene? I am just scared he may have a low while sleeping and just not wake up instead of having a seizure, which I wake up to the last two times. I need help???\noutput: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Diabetes Type 1 patients need to be under constant supervision of Doctors. You as a care taker for him, you should also be aware and educated about his health issues. The most common cause for twitching and convulsions in Diabetic patients is Hypoglycemia. There are more chances of Hypoglycemia during midnight, and early hours. Hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. I would say you immediately take him to Diabetes Specialist / Diabetes Nurse/ Physician or family Physician. If in case you do not have immediate access to the doctor, you do following1. Monitor regularly his blood glucose level, six times an day-before each meal (breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) and two hours after meals. Keep a recording. 2. Doses and type of Insulin Injection has to be determined according to the levels of Glucose. You may write us the dose, timings site and type of Injection Insulin he is taking, so we can advise you accordingly.3. Best thing is that we should avoid hypoglycemia, but if it happens you should immediately give him Some biscuits, Lump of sugar, Juice Etc. followed by some food with low Glycemic index. There may be some other reasons for Convulsions, which we have to look for, if the problem persist even after tight control of blood sugar. I have tried to give you some important relevant advise, though there are many more things to know and understand about Diabetes. Your boyfriend and you need thorough counselling and education about it.

I was wondering if there are any questions that we should be asking when we see her tomorrow. This will be an initial visit after a CT scan and Pulmonary function test.\noutput: Hello ! Pulmonary Fibrosis is a broad term. It can indicate a healed scar in the lung (most commonly due to treated TB in India) or it can indicate what is medically termed Interstitial Lung Disease (OLD) . In the former (post infective fibrosis) it is not a progressive disease. The latter (OLD) encompasses about 200 different causes of fibrosis and it most cases it can be progressive.  So the first thing that you should be asking your Consultant is what variety of fibrosis your parent has got and what is the exact diagnosis.  Coz the treatment for various OLD is different.  If there is any identifiable environmental or work related factor that has initiated the fibrosis then further avoidance of the factor is of utmost importance.  For few varieties of OLD steroid works while in few it doesn't.  So ask for the exact diagnosis, its extent of involvement in the lungs (whether localized or extensive, one lung or both the lungs), Ask for what all investigations need to be done to find out what OLD your parent has got, discuss the current status, treatment options and prognosis.  Ask for any lifestyle change that you need to incorporate.  Some IDs can be a manifestation of systemic disease so discuss whether it's the case in your parent, in which case the involvement of other organs also need to be investigated for in detail and treated.", "input: hello doctor i just want to ask about lung fibrosis. i was diagnosed to have TB in my left upper lung and i was treating anti tb drugs for 2 months now and i have regularly consulting my pulmonologist.my problem is on how the scar on my lungs will be totally disappear? is there any remedy for it?thanks\noutput: Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor....

The symptoms that you have mentioned can be due to anxiety or depression. A thyroid profile will be needed to rule out if underlying thyroid disorder is the cause for the same.

I understand how distressing it can be to go through such difficult times. Firstly, it is a good thing that you are able to have an insight about your problems and your current emotional state. I would appreciate you for gathering the initiative to seek help despite feeling low and dejected. From the description that you have given me, you seem to be going through a depression. The depression also seems to be causing you significant social and occupational disturbances. Hence, it is quite important that you seek professional help at the earliest. I would suggest that you have a consultation with a psychiatrist who would be able to assess you in detail and advice you the appropriate management plan. There are various treatment options available - medication, psychological / talking therapies, etc. Personally, I feel that since you seem to be having significant interpersonal difficulties also, you may benefit from psychological therapy, in addition to medication. It is also important to keep talking to and sharing your feelings with someone close to you, so that, in times when you are unable to think clearly or lack motivation or initiative, they will be able to guide you.

If problems are much severe I tell them to start antidepressant 20 days before the typical day of the year when usually problem starts and stop by the end of the season.

Could you help me!\noutput: HI, It is sad you do not have a doctor now, but visiting one of the neurologist at the earliest will be good if the symptoms have just started. Also, polymyositis is the inflammation of multiple muscle at a one single time. You need to be very careful to control the symptoms in the initial stages, This is one of the rare condition and many physicians do not come across. A neurologist is advised and based on the severity the medication will be straight away started. Sometimes, steroid compound is of choice to control the symptoms, as my last case of polymyositis. Now, once the situation comes under control, you really need to work out well. I personally implemented this protocol to my patient, and he is fine and mobile without any symptoms.* Meditation* Medication* Breathing Exercises* Physical therapy* Massage therapy etc. Always, require here is to understand the signs and symptoms, based on the proper neurological assessment and diagnostic reports, the medical treatment is guided.

He has recently had angioplasty in both legs at the same time. The left leg had a fair bit of narrowing at the grap and retired a stint. The right had some narrowing but only needed the balloon angioplasty. He has been back at work for approx three weeks and is complaining of a great deal of pain in the left leg and having great difficulty putting on sock and boot. We are quite worried and are looking for further advice.\noutput: Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Peripheral artery disease treated by stents can be of great functional improvement. In case if symptoms recur, its advisable to go for stent revision. Lifestyle modification is largely required in your case. The definitive management consists of Lumbar sympathectomy to interrupt the pain pathway.It's always advisable to keep the blood pressure under 130/80 mm of Hg. Avoid overt treatment to prevent lightheadedness, for this I advise you to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography, ECG,HS CRP and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart and degree of atherosclerosis. Restrict the intake of salt to less than 6g/day. Regular physical exercise in the form of brisk walk for 20 min a day for 5 days a week is pretty useful. Reduce the intake of fatty and fried food. Oatmeal for breakfast 30-50 gm taken in milk daily will clear the accumulated fat. One pomegranate a day will help to keep your heart at good pace without clot formation. Dizziness will go away, away once the headache and blood pressure will subside. Semiannual follow-ups are advisable on maintenance. Consult a Cardiologist for further expert management.

Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, and avoid meat.

If this has not been done, this may be the reason for the repeated infection. If your partner has been treated but your infection in still recurring, it is possible that it is not being adequately treated with the medication that you are using. It may be resistant to that therapy. Your doctor may need to look into other antibiotic options. I hope this helps", "input: My last relationship was with a man who was a swinger.  He is claiming that he didnt contract Chlamydia, but I had the infection.  How is it that he didnt have the infection like he claims when the sex between him and I was always unprotected?  Also, he was pressuring me to smoke meth, I dont think meth smoking alone can cause the infection?\noutput: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Occurrence of sexually transmitted disease like chlamydia in individuals is all about chance nothing can be told for sure that it will definitely happen or not happen. It will all depend on various other factors. In your case, as you happened to have an unprotected sex, there are chances of you getting the infection. Chlamydia is treated by either doxycycline 100 mg two times a day or azithromycin 1gm single dose. During the week of treatment please avoid sexual intercourse to get away of the cross infection to the partner. Partner also given the same treatment for same period. Once both of you are cured, you can resume with sexual activity.

Now I have left flank pain which is associated with a decrease in urine output, change in colour to muggy yellow/brown with some discomfort. This happened just a couple of months ago for 3 weeks and the doctor prescribed cipro for a UTI eventhough she didnt really think I had a UTI. I did not take the drug until the pain became excruciating. It did not help. About a week later the pain got better suddenly on its own and the day after that I had Strep throat. It seems that I do not have a functional immune system. I have asthma and get migraine headaches during every period.

Is it usual to be so hungry and to constantly eat?\noutput: Hi, Thanks for writing in. The human body requires meals adding up to 2000 kcal each day. It is best to have a heavy breakfast, moderate lunch and light dinner. In your case, since you are having a possible cancer in pancreas, the diet requirements might be slightly on higher side. Also, you are taking small meals which number about 5 to 7 each day. This is fine as long your meals are healthy. During illness the brain signals the body asking for more energy and that is a possible reason for persistent hunger. It will help to know any increase in body weight that has happened. You can continue the treatment with homeopathy, but regular scan must be done to know the position of the mass in pancreas. Since you have cut refined sugars, you can continue to have smaller meals with lots of fluids.

You are not just suffering from diverticular disease but also polypoid of the colon, a condition in which multiple polyps form in the colon and sometimes in the small bowel. Some of these polyps may with time develop cancer. Your having pain and weight loss are not good signs and more in favor of cancer development. I am assuming that the polyps that have been removed previously were sent for biopsy and that none of them showed cancer. I would advise you to first undergo a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. That will give us a fair idea of what we are dealing with and if there is any evidence of cancer development. Also, a colonoscopy is advisable (before the CT) but only by an experienced gastroenterologist in whose hands it shouldn't be a problem.", "input: I have a roommate that has previously had and been treated for Bowel Cancer by Radiation and Chemo .

He is refusing to do anything beyond that as he is from another country and has No Medical insurance. He intends to wait a month or two before he returns to Australia where he has medical insurance. What can he expect to happen if he doesn t do anything to take care of it immediately?\noutput: Hi, cancer of gastrointestinal tract has high chance of spread to the liver and other systemic organs including the brain. So if recurrence is evident you must have to go for offering him definitive treatment. There is no scope of delay because this disease leaves no such option. Please consult your nearby oncologist. If major surgery or chemotherapy is not possible there is the option for oral chemotherapy also which may help to keep the disease in control for at least sometime. Anyway he should return to home as early as possible to receive a full treatment.

As you know this needs to be examined physically to understand the extent of the condition. Also, as you mentioned you been to many doctors so have you ever been offered super potent topical or intraluminal corticosteroids?

He used to scratch till blood oozed out.I had Psorises, all over me suddenly in span of a couple of months, starting from a small patch on the outside of the elbow. We used a emuslion made from COCONUT SHELLS, I dont remember about it. It used to flareup every 2 or 3 years an random season. Never took any medication, but applied plenty of White Grease, and a solution of Solid Tar (The ONE USED for making Roads in the seventies with BENZENE.My father prohibited me from touching any patch.I used to clench my fist so tight that my nails dug into the palms and only applied the above medications. I ensured that I never have upset stomach--loose motion or constipation, drink 2 or3 liters of water, plenty of liver in diet apart from fish and chicken, and curd. Consequently in time, the itchy sensation  subsided and I came at peace with myself.The flaring up of Psorises was random and not linked with any season, The quoting of grease made summers difficult as I had a field job travelling 20 days plus, in a month. Exposure to sun and dust worsened the situation.Then in earsy ninetees Psorises took pity on me, or let us say I learnt to live with it and round then I came in touch with a Homeopath. He gave me PSORANIUM 200 for six months 4 times a day, and NUX VOMICA30 for one month every night initially in tandom. Then came MEZROL in 100,000 Potency, 4 timesa day, for about 6 months and weekly since then,No trace of Psorises now,except on my hairline on theforehead and at the back of my ears at the back. But that goes when I put MALAI from milk.

I have been suffering from memory problems since I was 18 years of age and with difficulty to remember new things, recent events and my past, studies, conversation with people, facts, very slow in thinking,. These days always keep quite during a discussion and cannot think on my own and when I try to say something it sounds boring and its does not make any sense. I often stop in the middle of conversation and forget to speak important points.Very difficult time to finish easy tasks and make decisions. Due to this issue I had to left my MBA preparation, few jobs while and my social life is almost screwed up. Actually there are many more issue with my memory; so I want to consult with a good doctor and can identify how to sort out these issue. Please advise me how should I go about this? And if you have any question, I am ready to answer it via email or phone. Your response is highly awaited and thank you in advance for replying.\noutput: DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your descriptions. I sincerely doubt your diagnosis that you have some memory problems. There are so many memory losing diseases and associated ones. You don't fit into any of them. Memory loss means not remembering to eat food, not able to recall what you ate for breakfast (sincerely), etc. The incidents you point out do happen to busy people and that is why keep a schedule of events and a calendar of appointments. Orators keep notes and refer them when they speak. Most people take a list while shopping trip. You don't have to worry about these silly happenings. Keep your brain active and work hard. Always say you have good memory. You will feel better. Don't lament yourself. Hope this answers your doubt. Available for further queries.

We also swept it up and wiped up the areas that had droppings. I am now terrified to learn that we shouldnt have done that. I have been driving self insane with worry.

You are 40 years old and have OCD since last 20 years. Now after catching mice and then cleaning house completely you have started having anxiety about getting Antivirus infection. First I would like to reassure you that such infections don't usually spread by just cleaning the house. Usually such infections spread more commonly in closed, damp areas like old ships, go downs etc. Not all mice are infected and prolonged contact is needed to get infection. So as per my opinion there is no need to worry. The fear of infection is probably due to severe anxiety you are having and this has got aggravated because of your history of OCD. Continue to take your OCD Chat Doctor.  Two days has already passed you are safe now.

In 90 percent of the cases, improvement is almost complete. The most useful thing you can do is to do physiotherapy with your face muscles. It is easy to do, and you can spend some minutes in the morning, evening or both to do. You can do it in front of the mirror.

Anxiety and panic disorder is something that runs in my family, though I feel mine is different - it s not so that I get panic attacks, its that I worry about everything that is given to me/ assignments/ social settings etc. I am a total perfectionist, which could also have triggered it, and throughout high school, I have struggled with this (I would feel overwhelmed with assignments, procrastinate, get upset if I didn t get over 90% etc). My body image is also something I struggle with. Lately however, I have become even more depressed ,stressed, and have been upset/crying for days.My head has been hurting for over a week (and I have booked an appointment with a doctor to look at that) and have minor chest pains as well. I am finding it even more difficult than usual to concentrate, read (I have to constantly re-read things just to understand them) and write/ say things (like the words are there but I just can t communicate them).I also have moments (like right now) where I am full of energy.

I feel that life is slipping away and happiness is forever gone. I know I need help but where? The doctors here are only out for money no one really cares\noutput: Dear Alison, thank you for your query. From your description, it appears that you are suffering from Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with anxious ruminations along with some components of Major Depressive Disorder. However, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), a disease characterized by repetitive, intrusive, distressing, irrational thoughts, images or impulses (regarded as products of patients own mind), needs to be ruled out before making a final diagnosis in your case. If I would a seen a patient with your complaints, I would have first confirmed the diagnosis by a detailed work up including thorough history taking and mental status and physical examination. If confirmed, I would have started with an SSRI (antidepressant) like Sertraline or Paroxetine or Escitalopram along with a benzodiazepine like Clonazepam or Mizoram to decrease the anxiety and induce sleep. Over weeks, I would have escalated the dose of SSRI and deescalated the dose of benzodiazepine. I would have also suggested a behavior therapy, like biofeedback, as means of non-pharmacologic treatment to aid the management. Please remember that GAD is a very common disorder encountered in clinical practice, and most cases are manageable with 6- 8 m"], ["input: I have von willebrands disease and currently over seas bc of my husband being in the military. the doctors on base do not know much a bout my disorder and can not help me get it back under control.

For the last few months Ive been to the hospital and clinic. I live on a small Island so theres not much option. It all started by this tightening of my chest and heart palpitations. I went to the hospital and the doctor told me  it was anxiety. It eventually went away on its own. Then I menstruated twice for 2 moths, so I was sent for blood work and a gynecologist. Pap test and exam was normal, but my blood came back as having a little bit of low iron. The doctor suggested I take iron pills. I didnt take them for a month and ended up back at the hospital for another reason and they took my blood again which showed my iron was still low but had went up a bit without the iron pills. I started the supplements afterwards and went back to the hospital a month later cause my knee swell up a bit and I got a bruise on it as well as other smalls ones on my other leg. They ran another test and said that my everything was normal except my red hemoglobins were a little small. I then went to the clinic and the doctor ordered more tests ( lupus, monopost, rheumatoid arthitis ) cause at this point I was getting aches and pains in my bones and joints as well as a few small bruises on my arms. Everything came back normal except my red blood cells are high and the mono came back positive. I asked the doctor why I tested positive for mono if I have no symptoms and he said I probably had it a long time ago.  He also said that my pains were probably cause of Fibromyalgia and the bruises were just the way my skin is. Also in the course of these few months my gums did bleed a few times when I brushed my teeth, but not recently.

I love been medication free but the pain has returned to impair my function, so, as suggested by my Dr., I am considering returning to methadone use (which I will discuss with him of course). My question is, I was still finding relief with .3mg methods 2 x day. Is there a pill form equivalent.\noutput: Hi, it is sad to know you had 3 joint replacements. It is unfortunate to hear such things. I have never seen any patient getting so much pain. Well, I think now it's time for you to indulge into an exercise program. Meet a physical therapist who is passionate and can see your case in detail and look forward for best planning. I am sure you will be helped. As to mention a small note, my patients with worst arthritis of 10 years I always advice them to undergo physical therapy and at times go for vigorous exercises. It has helped all and never I had a case where I was asked to go for joint replacements. Understanding the body of the individual and designing a great protocol surely helps. Focus on more of doing exercises for your core, hip muscles and overall body in the later stage. Get almost full ROM at all the joint, so the body stays at a unit. Undergoing too many surgeries will break your morale. But exercise will surely help you. Thank you", "input: Hello I have been sick for months . Started with a heavy cold, then pneomomia.

Ill just explain shortly whats troubling me and i hope that you will be able to give me your opinion of what should i do about it. About a month and few weeks ago i got infected with the ringworm. First i had a little itchy spot on one side of my body just below breast, i wasnt sure what was it until it developed and looked like a big ring. I went to doctor and was advised to use anti-fungal cream Lamisil, it didnt go away but spread. So all my neck was infected, full of smaller rings, they developed kinda differently though, as i could see the light reddish/pink ring from start, not a spot. Gone back to doctor and got another cream, Daktacort and travocort cream, it stopped the existing ringworms growing but after 3 weeks , all my body is infected by the ringworm. As is my boyfriends, but he seems to have it less. After closer looking (as i know by now what im looking) most of his arms and back is full of flaky rashes..Its wierd that on his skin they wont be as classic ringworm looking, more like batches of flaky skin, they only appear as ring-shaped rashes after the shower, so its really easy to miss them and to show doctor.

My head is itching as well, so i quess my scalp is infected as well.

Have had many kidney stones, had one blasted out, blood in my urine quite often, several times so much blood that you wouldnt even know that the substance was urine, it looked like pure blood, many UTIs, kidney failure 3 times on blood tests and 2 times resulted in hospital stays, many times unexplained side pains at the emergency room to find nothing wrong. When I was pregnant, my blood pressure and sugars were horrible, I had to give myself insulin shots 4 times a day, eventually I was taken to the hospital to control it, my kidneys were failing, they took them out early, at 33 weeks. My kidneys are scarred pretty badly, it says on most of my tests over the years, I have been to a urologist here, he could never find the reason this kept happening to me. He would be in the room and out as fast as he came in, I asked him numerous times to help me find out why this kept happening to me! Well last weekend I went in the the emergency room and the doctor told me two times that I had Polycystic kidney disease and that there wasnt anything they could do for me that wasnt already being done. I have polycystic ovarian disease, at first I thought that was what he said. He blamed my pain on gas and constipation ( which I know for sure is NOT true) and told me to get ahold of a kidney specialist, that he would put the number etc. on my paperwork. He did an abdominal cat scan, said there was a 3 mm kidney stone in my kidney and that my pain was caused from gas and constipation. I asked him about the PKD, because by then it had sunk in and he was very confused that I had no idea what he was talking about. He again said yes, you have PCOS and PKD. He wouldnt answer any questions I had about it after that. When I got home, I checked the paperwork, but it said nothing about my kidneys at all.

Already i am treating for this disease in India and taking some medicines also. Since upto now i dont have problem but may be in future it create. So please advise.\noutput: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. The kidneys are two organs, each about the size of a fist, located in the upper part of a person abdomen, toward the back. The kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood to form urine. They also regulate amounts of certain vital substances in the body. When cysts form in the kidneys, they are filled with fluid. PKD cysts can profoundly enlarge the kidneys while replacing much of the normal structure, resulting in reduced kidney function and leading to kidney failure. When PKD causes kidneys to fail-which usually happens after many years-the patient requires dialysis or kidney transplantation. About one-half of people with the most common type of PKD progress to kidney failure, also called end-stage renal disease (ESD). Please do not worry as many patients live for years on dialysis.

He has recently had angioplasty in both legs at the same time. The left leg had a fair bit of narrowing at the grap and retired a stint. The right had some narrowing but only needed the balloon angioplasty. He has been back at work for approx three weeks and is complaining of a great deal of pain in the left leg and having great difficulty putting on sock and boot. We are quite worried and are looking for further advice.\noutput: Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Peripheral artery disease treated by stents can be of great functional improvement. In case if symptoms recur, its advisable to go for stent revision. Lifestyle modification is largely required in your case. The definitive management consists of Lumbar sympathectomy to interrupt the pain pathway.It's always advisable to keep the blood pressure under 130/80 mm of Hg. Avoid overt treatment to prevent lightheadedness, for this I advise you to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography, ECG,HS CRP and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart and degree of atherosclerosis. Restrict the intake of salt to less than 6g/day. Regular physical exercise in the form of brisk walk for 20 min a day for 5 days a week is pretty useful. Reduce the intake of fatty and fried food. Oatmeal for breakfast 30-50 gm taken in milk daily will clear the accumulated fat. One pomegranate a day will help to keep your heart at good pace without clot formation. Dizziness will go away, away once the headache and blood pressure will subside. Semiannual follow-ups are advisable on maintenance. Consult a Cardiologist for further expert management. Post your further queries if any. Thank you."], ["input: Respected Sir, I am Narmada Padhy. My father Mr Chittaranjan Padhy is having Kidny stone problem .

As to mention a small note, my patients with worst arthritis of 10 years I always advice them to undergo physical therapy and at times go for vigorous exercises. It has helped all and never I had a case where I was asked to go for joint replacements. Understanding the body of the individual and designing a great protocol surely helps. Focus on more of doing exercises for your core, hip muscles and overall body in the later stage. Get almost full ROM at all the joint, so the body stays at a unit. Undergoing too many surgeries will break your morale. But exercise will surely help you.

Go for pulmonary function tests as well. Sip on warm water. Avoid cold Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It is important to know the type and stage of cancer that she is having. If she is 16 years old and the cancer is in early stage then survival chances are high.

Around a week ago, I was told I dont have mononucleosis anymore, my liver is all fine now, just the EB virus is ending.. or how could I say? Lingering? I wasnt told to go to another blood test, so I would like to ask, if it is okay to kiss, if the EB virus is still lingering? How long will it .. linger? I was told I can even do sports, even though I read everywhere, that a person shouldnt do sports for atleast 2 months. Thank you in advance for your reply. I couldnt find a reply to my question anywhere.\noutput: Hi there, Good question, you don't need a repeat blood test, and it is good to hear you are overall recovering.  It is difficult to know how long you will shed the virus in your saliva, so to play it completely safe I would check with the person you intend to share physical contact and let them know about your recent illness.  Some experts believe the virus could be transmissible up to 6-18 months after getting the initial diagnosis though you most likely wouldn't have symptoms that far out after having the initial bout of symptoms.
