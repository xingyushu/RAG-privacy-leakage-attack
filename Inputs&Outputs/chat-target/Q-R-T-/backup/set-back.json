Im afraid the result will be surgery. What do you think? I meet with a Opthomologist tomorrow to have a vision screening done b/c my vision is blurred. I have extreme headaches and so much memory loss. I will be seeing a neurosurgeon as well ASAP. Im scared.\noutput: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Yes, your guess is correct. Most likely, your neurosurgeon would advise you for a surgery. However, there is no need to worry, as the tumor of pituitary is most often benign (such as pituitary adenoid or craniopharyngioma). Once they are operated, you would improve for good. The most likely cause of your headaches and memory loss is the tumor. Also, in most cases, the pituitary surgery can be done through nose, without opening the skull. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/\n\ninput: I am 19 and have 2 pituitary tumors. was told that the tumors are not causing headaches but i have one everyday some days are very bad and i feel shaky all over and anything i take for my headache does not work. I have recently loss my appetite i am getting worried and feeling bad.\noutput: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that the pituitary gland is the most important hormonal gland in our body. It regulated the balance of many hormones. Your symptoms could be related to a hormonal imbalance. That is why I would recommend consulting with an endocrinologist and performing some hormone levels (TSH, LH, GH, GRH, TRY, FSH, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). A new MRI would be needed to evaluate the possible progression of the tumor. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Wishing all the best, ", "infor": "input: basically i have been repeating myself alot lately i used to do it in the past but its been more common. its not like a stutter or stammer its only with one word out of a sentence. i will be speaking normally and then it hits me and i find my self repeating the word or sentance over and over sometimes even up to 20times. the wierdest thing is i can break away from saying it but to carry on telling the story i have to repeat it again. i was wondering if you have any answers as to what could be happening.\noutput: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  From the description it is not easy to diagnose you properly. But I see a case of obsession here without any underlying physical / physiological cause. You had that disturbing sensation once. You expected it to happen again and tried. Then you started experiencing it as you were expecting it. Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms. Ignore it and the problem vanishes. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.\n\ninput: hello sir, i need ur help , there is always a story or a play running in my mind. like if i m watching tv show then the story of tv start running in my mind nd i start associating myself with them,,, i feel i m talking with them,,,,,v r doing fun togather..v r going to college nd party...but in real i m in home nd all this is just creation of my mind.. i tried a lot to get rid of these stupdity. i  tried to concentrate on my work to make myself busy. but when i m free. all these absurd thing started again in my mind....my memory is alo become very weak now. i forget things where i placed just a second before... i feel very hesitated to this to my parents ...plz help me what to do\noutput: Hello, I think your problem is OCD. In this person knows that his thoughts/actions are absurd, and he tries to resist or stop, but is unable to do so. You need treatment with anti-obsessional Chat Doctor. Once your thoughts are in your control, your memory and concentration would improve. Thanks."}
